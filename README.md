## Quick Start [:rewind:](#read-me)

Good Luck!

## About [:rewind:](#read-me)

This WP  theme is called Immaterialize, v-0.0.1-alpha. The theme is in some sort of alpha stage. The conceit of the theme is that it began as "a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, if you like" which was downloaded, with sass installed, from http://underscores.me/ and interlaced with Materialize, v1.0.0rc. "a modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design." Therefore, "Immaterialize is based on [Underscores](https://underscores.me/), (C) 2012-2017 Automattic, Inc" with front-end framework Materialize.

Materialize, by Alvin Wang, Alan Chang, Alex Mark, and Kevin Louie, includes code from AnimeJS, the JavaScript Animation Engine by Julian Garner; Cash-dom by Ken Wheeler, Waves by Alfiana E. Sibuea and other contributors, and Normalize.css by Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal.

Names, licenses, and links are [credited below](#credits-rewind).

I have noticed that most of the third-party code that is utilized by Materialize is not up-to-date with each individual project's current version.
