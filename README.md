## About [:rewind:](#read-me)

This WP  theme is called Immaterialize and is in some sort of alpha stage. The conceit of the theme is that it began as "a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, if you like" which was downloaded, with sass installed, from http://underscores.me/ and interlaced with Materialize, v1.0.0rc. "a modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design." Therefore, "Immaterialize is based on [Underscores](https://underscores.me/), (C) 2012-2017 Automattic, Inc."

Materialize, by Alvin Wang, Alan Chang, Alex Mark, and Kevin Louie, includes code from AnimeJS, the JavaScript Animation Engine by Julian Garner; Cash-dom by Ken Wheeler and Waves by Alfiana E. Sibuea and other contributors.

Names, licenses, and links are [credited below](#credits-rewind).

I have noticed that most of the third-party code that is utilized by Materialize is not up-to-date with each individual project's current version.

### Who [:rewind:](#read-me)

Your Mom.

### What [:rewind:](#read-me)

WP theme in some sort of alpha stage. While Materialize is registered and enqueued it has not been completely checked.
The plan
- [x] Add PrismJS
- [ ] Add HTML5 Boilerplate
  - [ ] Materialize, v1.0.0-beta deploys normalize.css v7.0.0. HTML5 Boilerplate, v6.1.0 deploys normalize.css v8.0.0
  - [ ] HTML5 Boilerplate main.css may have  styles beneficial after a closer reading
  - [ ] Modernizr 3.6.0 (Custom Build) deserves a closer reading. https://modernizr.com/download/?-cssanimations-csscolumns-customelements-flexbox-history-picture-pointerevents-postmessage-sizes-srcset-webgl-websockets-webworkers-addtest-domprefixes-hasevent-mq-prefixedcssvalue-prefixes-setclasses-testallprops-testprop-teststyles
  - [ ] Is there a benefit to jquery at this time?
  - [ ] Further look if it is useful to pursue a "simple, quick way to concatenate, minify, and version static files in a Wordpress theme" https://gist.github.com/necolas/2347014
- [ ] Develop away from the underscores' basic Customizer using the elaborate [Make](https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/make/), by The Theme Foundry, as a reference point.
  - [ ] Typography
  - [ ] Colors
- [ ] Sketch out a more elaborate use of responsive delivery using Materialize.
- [ ] Enable Materialize within existing barebones framework.
- [ ] Elaborate the bare bones of the starter theme's framework.
